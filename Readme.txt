Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!

working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. In order to answer the key business questions, 

started the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,share, and act. 

Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, I have to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
